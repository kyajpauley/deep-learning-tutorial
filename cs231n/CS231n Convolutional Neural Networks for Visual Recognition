This is probably just going to be a notes file, will make directories as needed for organization

Jupyter notebooks
-trying to run notebooks in a directory other than the default directory is really annoying
-was able to get it to run in repo notebooks directory with following command
    jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=..\..\..\git-repos\deep-learning-tutorial\notebooks
    -I don't know if that saved the default dir to there, will see next time start up
-to run jupyter notebooks from winpython, go to winpython folder, click shortcut
    -can also cd to file and run jupyter notebook from there

-having problems getting kernels to connect while using winpython version
    -location of notebooks dir doesn't seem to matter
-retrying jupyter installation using anaconda
    -was able to get kernel working
    -have no idea how to get the notebook to start in preferred directory...

was finally able to fix target dir to start notebooks
    -open cwp.py file in anaconda directory
    -near end of file there is a line like this: os.chdir(documents_folder)
    -commented it out, changed to os.chdir('E:\\git-repos\\deep-learning-tutorial\\notebooks')
    -yay it works now
